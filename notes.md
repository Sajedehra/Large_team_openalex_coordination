In this study the first author made the mistake of not creating an open notebook from the beginning. Based on the date of this document, it can be traced that which decisions are being taken prior to seeing the results.

What has happened until now (September 11):

- study on citation, citation second year, and time corrected citation (correlation, pairwise rank comparison, descrptives, percentiles)
- study of impact factor (correlation, pairwise rank comparison, descrptives, percentiles)
- early version of network

Meeting sep 11:

- we decided on the points of introduction
- we decided to look into the individual contributions of big team author papers.
- We have to make a decision what counts as prestige, as we may look into it.
- we decided the missing authors should be removed.

Meeting Sep 25:

- we decided we do not have a reasonable comparison point at this stage for network analysis, so we will drop it from the analysis.

Sep 29:

- I just found out there are more non-articles in the data through reading the randomly selected papers for qualitative part of the project. I will add "Day-by Day" to the keywords for cleaning the data, and remove from the current dataset.
