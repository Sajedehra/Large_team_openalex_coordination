In this study the first author made the mistake of not creating an open notebook from the beginning. Based on the date of this document, it can be traced that which decisions are being taken prior to seeing the results.

What has happened until now (September 11):

- study on citation, citation second year, and time corrected citation (correlation, pairwise rank comparison, descrptives, percentiles)
- study of impact factor (correlation, pairwise rank comparison, descrptives, percentiles)
- early version of network

Meeting sep 11:

- we decided on the points of introduction
- we decided to look into the individual contributions of big team author papers.
- We have to make a decision what counts as prestige, as we may look into it.
- we decided the missing authors should be removed.
